# Project Title: School Shuttle Management System

## Domain: Education & Transportation

## Problem Statement

Schools face significant challenges in managing shuttle services, including inefficient route planning, lack of real-time tracking, and poor communication between students, parents, and school administrators. The School Shuttle Management System is designed to address these challenges by offering:

Real-time GPS tracking of school shuttles.

Optimized route planning to minimize travel time and fuel consumption.

Automated notifications to inform parents and school staff of shuttle arrival times.

A web and mobile-based platform to allow stakeholders to access shuttle information conveniently.

## Individual Scope

This project is feasible for an individual as it involves developing a cloud-based system that integrates GPS tracking, route optimization, and real-time notifications using modern web and mobile technologies. The core features include:

GPS Tracking Integration: Real-time location updates of school shuttles.

Route Optimization: AI-driven suggestions for the most efficient shuttle routes.

## User Roles:

Students & Parents: View real-time shuttle locations and receive notifications.

Drivers: Receive optimized routes and update shuttle status.

School Administrators: Manage routes, schedules, and monitor shuttle activity.

## Technology Stack

Frontend: React (Web), Flutter (Mobile)

Backend: Node.js with Express.js

Database: PostgreSQL

Cloud Services: AWS for hosting, Firebase for real-time notifications

APIs: Google Maps API for GPS tracking and route optimization

## C4 Architectural Diagrams

## Level 1: System Context Diagram

This diagram illustrates how different users interact with the School Shuttle Management System:

Students & Parents use a Mobile App to track shuttles and receive notifications.

Drivers use a Mobile App to receive and update route status.

School Administrators access a Web Dashboard to manage routes and schedules.

The system integrates with GPS APIs for real-time tracking.

## Level 2: Container Diagram

The system is broken down into major containers:

Web Application (React) for school administrators

Mobile Application (Flutter) for students, parents, and drivers

Backend Server (Node.js, Express.js) to handle system logic

Database (PostgreSQL) to store user data, routes, and logs

Cloud Services (AWS, Firebase) for hosting and notifications

## Level 3: Component Diagram

This diagram details the core system components:

Authentication Service (Manages user login and role-based access)

GPS Tracking Module (Fetches real-time shuttle locations via GPS APIs)

Route Optimization Engine (AI-based route planning)
