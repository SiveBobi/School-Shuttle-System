# âœ… Test Cases for School Shuttle Management System

This section provides a set of **functional test cases** that validate the behavior of the system as defined in the use case specifications, as well as **non-functional test scenarios** to validate performance and security aspects.

## ðŸš€ Non-Functional Test Scenarios

### âœ… NF-TC-001: Performance Test â€“ Real-Time Updates

- **Test Type**: Performance  
- **Scenario**: Simulate 1,000 users viewing the shuttle location map concurrently.  
- **Expected Result**: All users receive location updates within 5 seconds.  
- **Tool/Note**: Use load testing tool (e.g., JMeter or BlazeMeter) to simulate traffic.

### âœ… NF-TC-002: Security Test â€“ Unauthorized Access Attempt

- **Test Type**: Security  
- **Scenario**: Attempt to access the admin dashboard without authentication (e.g., expired token or incorrect role).  
- **Expected Result**: Access denied, system logs unauthorized access attempt.  
- **Security Mechanism**: JWT authentication and role-based access control (RBAC)
