The Use Case Diagram for the School Shuttle Management System illustrates the interactions between different actors and the system's functionalities. The Passenger can book, view, cancel, track, and rate shuttle services, while the Parent shares tracking and alert features and manages child bookings. The Driver is responsible for managing routes, updating statuses, logging driving hours, and reporting shuttle issues. The Admin oversees fleet management, driver assignments, schedule updates, handles complaints, and generates reports. The Traffic Inspector ensures compliance and reports safety violations. The System automates tasks such as sending alerts, processing bookings, and handling reports. This diagram highlights the roles and relationships of each actor, ensuring efficient coordination and seamless shuttle operations.
