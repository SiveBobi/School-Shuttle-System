### üß© Integration with Prior Work (10 Marks)

This section explains how the **Activity Diagrams** and **State Transition Diagrams** align with and support the previously established components of the system, such as the **requirements specification**, **use case models**, and **architecture diagrams**. The goal is to demonstrate consistency and traceability throughout the system design.

---

#### üîÅ Consistency with Requirements and Use Cases:

- **Use Cases Covered**: Each activity diagram directly supports specific use cases identified in the requirements phase (e.g., "Place Order", "Login", "Return Item").
- **Functional Requirements Mapping**:
  - Activity and state diagrams both clearly reflect the expected system behavior from the Functional Requirements Document (e.g., FR-001 to FR-051).
  - Transitions and states (e.g., `CheckedOut`, `Pending`, `Delivered`) are derived from the system's defined functionality.

---

#### üß† Alignment with System Architecture:

- **Logical Flow**: Activity diagrams represent the business logic and workflows, providing a visual layer between use cases and technical implementation.
- **State Consistency**: Each object in the system (e.g., `Book`, `Order`, `User Account`) maintains a valid lifecycle that is aligned with backend logic shown in the architecture and database models.
- **Error Handling**: Diagrams also incorporate real-world flows like error messages and retries (e.g., failed login, failed payment), ensuring robust coverage.

---

#### üîó Integration Strategy:

- **Forward and Backward Traceability**: Each state and activity maps back to a requirement or a use case, and forward to components of the implementation.
- **Scalability**: The diagrams are designed to allow for additional states or activities as the system evolves (e.g., adding "Digital Products" to inventory).

#### ‚úÖ Benefits of Integration:

- **Improved Developer Understanding**: Engineers can easily see how components interact through lifecycles and workflows.
- **Reduced Redundancy**: Avoids rework and inconsistency by aligning all artifacts in the system lifecycle.
- **Enhanced Maintainability**: Any future change in requirements or architecture can be traced across the design components.
