### ðŸªž Reflection (10 Marks)

This section provides a reflection on the overall process of modeling the system using **UML diagrams**, discussing the challenges, lessons learned, and how this activity contributes to better software design and understanding.

---

#### ðŸ’­ Challenges Encountered:

- **Complexity of Mapping Real-World Scenarios**: Translating real-world processes (like book reservations or payments) into formal UML diagrams required careful analysis of business logic and exception handling.
- **Ensuring Diagram Consistency**: Maintaining consistency between activity diagrams, state diagrams, and previously developed use cases and architecture was challenging and required several iterations.
- **Tool Limitations**: Some diagramming tools or platforms (e.g., GitHub markdown not rendering Mermaid directly) posed limitations in visualization and required additional formatting work.

#### ðŸŽ“ Lessons Learned:

- **Importance of Visual Modeling**: Visual models like activity and state diagrams make it easier to communicate complex ideas and system flows to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
- **Clarity through States and Activities**: Clearly defining the lifecycle of each object and workflow ensures that edge cases (like payment failure or account suspension) are properly addressed.
- **Traceability and Integration**: Diagrams serve as bridges between requirements, implementation, and testing phases by enabling traceability and ensuring all system parts align.

#### ðŸš€ Contribution to System Understanding:

- **Improved Collaboration**: Team members can understand system behavior quickly through visual aids, supporting better collaboration during development.
- **Faster Onboarding**: New developers or stakeholders can use the diagrams as learning tools to get up to speed with system logic and workflows.
- **Foundation for Testing**: The defined states and transitions serve as the basis for test case design, ensuring all functionalities are covered.

#### âœ… Final Thought:

Modeling with UML deepened our understanding of the system and improved our ability to foresee design flaws early. It also created a strong foundation for system implementation, integration, and long-term maintenance.
