# School-Shuttle-System

The School Shuttle Management System is designed to streamline transportation for students by providing real-time GPS tracking, optimized route planning, and automated notifications for parents, students, and school administrators. The system consists of a mobile app for students and parents to track shuttles, a driver interface for updating route statuses, and a web dashboard for school administrators to manage schedules. The backend integrates with GPS APIs for location tracking, AI-based route optimization, and cloud services like Firebase for real-time alerts. This ensures a safer, more efficient, and transparent school transportation system.
