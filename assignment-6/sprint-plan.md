## 🚀 Contribution to MVP

This sprint delivers the foundational features that make the product usable and valuable to early users (i.e., parents, students, and drivers). By completing Sprint 1, the following **MVP goals are met**:

- Parents can receive real-time alerts about shuttle movement.
- Students and parents can track shuttle location from their devices.
- Drivers can communicate status (e.g., “En Route”, “Delayed”).
- Admins can assign routes and drivers for operational readiness.

> ✅ These features provide the core value of the system — communication and visibility — which are critical for a functional MVP.
