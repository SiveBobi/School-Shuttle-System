# 🔍 Reflection: Challenges in Agile Planning

Adopting agile planning for the School Shuttle Management System came with several learning curves and challenges:

---

## 🧠 Understanding User Stories

It was challenging to write **clear and independent user stories** without overlapping functionality. We had to learn to break down broad requirements (e.g., "shuttle tracking") into atomic tasks that are testable and valuable.

---

## 📊 Prioritizing the Product Backlog

Ranking the backlog was difficult due to varying stakeholder needs. For example, while GPS tracking is essential for students, the admin might prioritize performance reports. We addressed this by focusing on **user-facing functionality first**.

---

## ⏳ Estimating Story Points

Estimating complexity using story points was tricky as we had limited experience. We used a relative scale (1 = very easy, 13 = complex) and focused on **team consensus**.

---

## 📅 Sprint Planning

It was difficult to choose features for Sprint 1 that were both valuable and realistic in the timeframe. We decided to prioritize features that enable **shuttle visibility and alerts**, as these are high-impact.

---

## 🤝 Team Collaboration

Asynchronous communication and role assignments (Product Owner, Scrum Master) were simulated since this was an individual or small team task. In a real team setting, collaboration would be essential.

---

## ✅ Lessons Learned

- Agile is not just about speed — it's about **delivering value iteratively**.
- User stories are more effective when tied to **specific user goals**.
- Continuous feedback loops are essential to improve backlog accuracy and sprint outcomes.

> This exercise deepened my understanding of agile thinking, planning, and adaptability — all of which are essential for successful software delivery.
