# ðŸ“Œ **Kanban Board Explanation (20 Marks)**  

## **Task:**  
A Kanban board is a visual management tool that helps teams track and visualize the flow of tasks from start to finish. It is designed to optimize workflow, ensure smooth task progression, and maintain transparency within the team.  

### **Kanban Board Definition:**  
A **Kanban board** is a visual tool used to manage and track tasks throughout their lifecycle. It uses columns to represent different stages of work, such as "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done," providing a clear view of task status. Each task is represented by a card that moves through the columns, ensuring visibility and clarity for the entire team.  

### **How Our Kanban Board Visualizes Workflow:**  
- The **columns** on our Kanban board represent different stages of task progress. For example, tasks begin in the **"To Do"** column, move to **"In Progress"** when being worked on, and end in **"Done"** when completed.  
- Additional columns like **"Testing"** and **"Blocked"** help track specific needs, such as QA validation or tasks requiring external input, giving us a more detailed view of the workflow.

### **How Our Kanban Board Limits Work-in-Progress (WIP):**  
- To avoid bottlenecks and ensure focus, we limit the number of tasks in each column (Work-in-Progress or WIP). For instance, we limit **"In Progress"** to 3 tasks at a time. This helps team members prioritize and finish tasks before taking on new ones, leading to a smoother workflow and faster delivery.

### **How Our Kanban Board Supports Agile Principles:**  
- **Continuous Delivery:** Tasks are constantly moving through the workflow, ensuring that we are always delivering value incrementally.  
- **Adaptability:** Our board is easily adaptable, allowing us to adjust task priorities, add new columns, or change workflows as needed.  
- **Transparency:** The board gives all team members a clear view of whatâ€™s being worked on, who is responsible for what, and the overall progress of tasks.
