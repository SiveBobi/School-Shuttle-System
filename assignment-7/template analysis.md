# ðŸ“Œ **Template Analysis and Selection (30 Marks)**  

## **Task:**  
We explored GitHubâ€™s project templates, including **Basic Kanban**, **Automated Kanban**, **Bug Triage**, and **Team Planning**. Below is a comparison table of three templates, highlighting their key features, automation capabilities, and suitability for Agile methodologies.

### **Comparison Table:**

| **Template Name**        | **Columns & Workflow**                           | **Automation Features**                        | **Suitability for Agile Methodologies**     |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Basic Kanban**          | To Do, In Progress, Done                        | No automation                                | Good for small teams or simple workflows   |
| **Automated Kanban**      | To Do, In Progress, Done                        | Auto-moves issues between columns based on status updates | Best for Agile workflows, supports sprint tracking |
| **Bug Triage**            | To Do, In Progress, Needs Review, Done          | Auto-assigns bugs to team members, Moves issues based on status updates | Suitable for bug tracking and Agile teams working on fixing bugs |
| **Team Planning**         | Backlog, In Progress, Review, Done              | Assigns tasks automatically, Supports sprint planning | Ideal for Scrum teams needing detailed planning and review |

### **Justification for Template Selection:**

We selected the **Automated Kanban** template for our project. This template aligns perfectly with our needs because:
- **Built-in Automation**: It supports automatic movement of issues between columns, which ensures a smooth workflow without manual updates.
- **Agile Compatibility**: The template is designed with Agile methodologies in mind, supporting continuous delivery and adaptability. It helps track tasks across stages like **To Do**, **In Progress**, and **Done**, making it easy to manage sprint tasks.
- **Efficiency**: The automated transitions between columns save time and reduce the possibility of human error, which is especially helpful in an Agile environment where quick iterations and progress tracking are critical.

This template best supports our sprint cycles and task management needs, ensuring a streamlined process for managing project progress.
