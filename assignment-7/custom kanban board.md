# ðŸ“Œ **Custom Kanban Board Creation (40 Marks)**  

## **Task:**  
We customized a **GitHub Kanban board** to align with our Agile workflow. The following steps were taken to create and tailor the board:  

### **Step 1: Create a GitHub Project**  
- We selected the **Automated Kanban** template to streamline issue tracking and task progression.  

### **Step 2: Board Customization**  
We modified the default structure by adding two new columns:  
âœ… **Testing** â€“ Ensures QA validation before marking a task as complete.  
ðŸš§ **Blocked** â€“ Tracks tasks that require additional support, approvals, or resources.  

### **Step 3: Populating the Board with Sprint Tasks**  
- Imported **tasks from Assignment 6** (previous sprint plan).  
- Linked relevant **GitHub Issues (user stories)** to the board.  
- Categorized tasks using labels such as `bug`, `feature`, and `enhancement`.  
- Assigned tasks to team members using **@mentions** to clarify ownership.

Labels such as `bug`, `feature`, and `enhancement` were used for better categorization, ensuring smooth collaboration among team members.*
