# ðŸ“Œ **Custom Kanban Board Creation (40 Marks)**  

## **Task:**  
In this section, we will explain how we created and customized our GitHub Kanban board, linked tasks from our previous sprint plan, and assigned team members to tasks using @mentions. 

### **Step 1: Create a GitHub Project using the Selected Template**  
We selected the **Automated Kanban** template for our project, as it supports sprint tracking with built-in automation, which aligns well with Agile principles. This template allows automatic movement of tasks between columns as their status is updated, which helps streamline the workflow.

### **Step 2: Customize the Board by Adding 2+ New Columns**  
We customized the default columns of the **Automated Kanban** template by adding two new columns:
- **Testing**: This column is dedicated to tasks that are in the QA validation phase before they are marked as complete.
- **Blocked**: This column tracks tasks that are delayed or require additional support, approvals, or resources to proceed.

These additions align with our project needs, ensuring better tracking of tasks in different stages and more detailed visibility into potential bottlenecks.

### **Step 3: Populate the Board with Tasks from Our Previous Sprint Plan (Assignment 6)**  
We populated the Kanban board with tasks from our previous sprint plan (Assignment 6). Tasks were linked to GitHub Issues (user stories) and categorized according to their type, such as:
- **bug** 
- **feature**
- **enhancement**

Each issue was moved through the workflow, from **To Do** to **In Progress**, then **Testing**, and finally **Done**. This allowed us to visualize the task progress in real-time.

### **Linking GitHub Issues (User Stories) to the Board**  
Each task was linked to a specific GitHub Issue that represented the user story. For example, a task related to fixing a bug was labeled with the **bug** label, while a task for adding a new feature was labeled as a **feature**. This helps us organize tasks based on their type and easily track their progress.

### **Assigning Tasks to Team Members**  
We assigned tasks to team members using @mentions in GitHub Issues. This ensures clear responsibility for each task and allows team members to receive notifications when they are assigned to tasks or when updates are made.

### **Explanation of Customization Choices:**  
- **â€˜Testingâ€™ Column**: We added the **Testing** column to ensure that tasks undergoing QA validation are tracked separately. This allows us to verify that all work passes testing before being marked as done.
- **â€˜Blockedâ€™ Column**: The **Blocked** column was added to ensure visibility for tasks that are delayed or waiting on external factors (e.g., approvals, resources). This helps the team quickly identify and resolve blockers.
  
These customizations support our projectâ€™s workflow and ensure tasks are tracked through all necessary stages. The ability to categorize tasks with labels such as **bug**, **feature**, and **enhancement** adds an extra layer of organization to the board.
