# ðŸ“Œ **Reflection (10 Marks)**  

## **Task:**  
In this section, we reflect on the challenges faced while selecting and customizing the GitHub Kanban board template. We also compare GitHubâ€™s Kanban templates to other popular tools, such as Trello and Jira.

### **Challenges in Selecting and Customizing the Template:**  
When selecting the GitHub Kanban board template, we had to consider the simplicity and automation of the options available. While the **Automated Kanban** template suited our needs, integrating custom workflows and setting up automation rules was a bit challenging for team members who were unfamiliar with GitHub Projects. Customizing columns such as **"Testing"** and **"Blocked"** required a clear understanding of our projectâ€™s stages and dependencies. It took some trial and error to ensure the board accurately reflected our projectâ€™s needs, but once set up, it streamlined our workflow.

One key challenge was ensuring the WIP limits were set up correctly to prevent bottlenecks, as GitHub doesnâ€™t have built-in WIP limits like some other tools. We manually tracked the number of tasks in each column, which required additional attention from the team.

### **Comparison of GitHubâ€™s Kanban Templates to Other Tools (e.g., Trello, Jira):**  
- **GitHub Projects**: GitHubâ€™s Kanban board offers simplicity and integrates well with the development process, especially for teams already using GitHub for version control. It allows seamless linking of GitHub Issues (user stories) directly to the board, making it easy to track development tasks. However, it lacks some advanced features like easy drag-and-drop task prioritization, which other tools like Trello offer.
  
- **Trello**: Trello is highly intuitive and user-friendly, offering more customization in task card design and labels. It allows you to easily add due dates, checklists, and attachments to cards. It also has a more flexible and customizable WIP limit feature. However, Trello lacks native issue tracking integration for code-related tasks and does not have as strong version control support as GitHub.
  
- **Jira**: Jira provides a robust, comprehensive project management system that includes advanced features such as custom workflows, reporting, and sprints, making it ideal for larger Agile teams or software projects. It integrates well with development tools and supports advanced task tracking with customizable boards. However, Jira can be overwhelming for smaller teams or non-technical projects due to its complexity.

In conclusion, while GitHubâ€™s Kanban board is great for teams already using GitHub, tools like Trello and Jira offer more specialized features for broader project management needs.
